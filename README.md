# Business Site

Prototype law office website built with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Static website is made with:
Programmatic navigation between various pages, React hook system for a custom reusable dropdown component, custom JavaScript function for phone number syntax validation from user input and reverse geocoding API call to obtain City and State (within the US) for input elements.

Project is still in progress. More styling and additional features to resolve bugs will be added at a later time.
