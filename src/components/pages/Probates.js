                    When you have recently lost a loved one, perhaps the last thing you want to do is to immerse yourself in a time-consuming, highly detailed legal process. Unfortunately, that is the situation many people face.

                    After a death, the deceased’s estate typically has to go through the legal process known as probate. While probate in Washington is typically easier and less expensive than it is in other states, the whole process can be intimidating and even overwhelming, especially for people who are grieving the loss of a loved one.

                    When you are in this situation, you can greatly benefit from the services of a lawyer who knows the probate system and is sensitive to what you are going through. At Amanda K Clark Law, we understand the importance of listening, finding out what part of the estate is most important to you — whether it’s assets, real estate, items of sentimental value or something else — and helping you to understand the best ways to protect it.

                    Drawing on their years of experience, our attorneys show our clients how probate works and what alternatives there may be, what to expect and how to get through it as easily as possible.
